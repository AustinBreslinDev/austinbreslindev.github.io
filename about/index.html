        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>
            Nearly everyone who is a developer or IT technician has an interesting story about how they got introduced to programming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a game that came with the computer that was in my house that I played a lot, maybe too much. The computer was 
            becoming slow. I decided that I would fix this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took the computer apart, not really knowing if that would solve the problem but at least it would give me a clue.
            My family watched in horror, because they thought I had broken the computer. I could not imagine me watching
            a child take apart a computer without jumping in to stop them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I put the computer back together and somehow stumbled accross disk cleanup and disk defrag and this resolved the problem. 
            I could now play the game again without losing any FPS.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1">
        <h3>The progression:</h3>
        <p>
            Not satisfied with the results though, I decided to make more adjustments to the computer. I found GNU/Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
            After installing Linux, I found that the screen resoultion was wrong, the graphics card was not supported. I spent
            around 4 weeks reading forums trying to find a solutino. Most of the time was wasted playing around with the options 
            to be honest.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is when I decided to make Linux my OS of choice, even the hard stuff was understandable and people wanted to help.
            A big difference from the OS I was using before. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1">
        <h3>Introduction to Programming:</h3>
        <p>
            There was a person in the local community center who was advertising teaching children how to write HTML. I decided
            to go and see, as I thought it would be an intorduction to programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it was good, it was not what I was looking for. Stumped as to where to go next in computers, I stopped.
            There was about a 4 to 5 year pause in my deveolopment in computers. When I went to college, doing nanotechnology I was 
            reintroduced into programming through a scrience programming language, that is copyright protected so I won't name it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The copyrighted language was a good, but a carrer in nanotechnology wasn't a carrer in programming.
            After the first year of nanotechnology, I decided to leave and go do a programming degree instead.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1">
        <h3>The road to becoming a developer:</h3>
        <p>
            After leaving the programming degree there was no real progression for me, in my opinion. I was applying
            for anything releated to computers at the time. After about 9 months, I found an internship with a local company.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where I meet a developer who was willing to mentor me and answer any and all questions that I had to ask.
            Some of these questions were insane now that I look back at them. I once asked which was faster JSF or JSP and for him
            to explain the difference. I even asked him if client side or server side was the way to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            His response to these questions was amazing, he even proposed that I not look at what technique was faster but at what was
            best for the problem at hand. He even made me question the programming language that I knew and the company used. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these questions and through his guidence I built a full stack system many times over. One JSP, One JSF, one using 
            JavaScript and Servlets, one using Typescript and Servlets. All so I could see what he was trying to get me to understand.
