        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>
            Nearly everyone who is a developer or IT technician has an interesting story about how they got introduced to programming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a game that came with the computer that was in my house that I played a lot, maybe too much. The computer was 
            becoming slow. I decided that I would fix this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took the computer apart, not really knowing if that would solve the problem but at least it would give me a clue.
            My family watched in horror, because they thought I had broken the computer. I could not imagine me watching
            a child take apart a computer without jumping in to stop them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I put the computer back together and somehow stumbled across disk cleanup and disk defrag and this resolved the problem. 
            I could now play the game again without losing any FPS.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Why this website?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This website really is just an archiving system for me, while at the same time sharing any tips 
            and tricks that I learn while programming. It will also have some computer repair and mobile repair
            on occasion as I still do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            The languages that I have used/tried learning in the past or I am currently work with are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Java, this was the first language that I was proficient in and started my career with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    C#, this is the language that I use in my day to day work now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Python. Used it for the easy introduction to desktop GUI apps through WXPython.
                </li>
                <li>
                    MatLab, this was for academic/mathematical reasons and I did not really use it.
                    But I did like creating graphs with it, but obviously this was the niche this language
                    was created for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript, used this mostly within the browser, but have written scripts in NodeJS.
                    This website is built using NodeJS and a few custom build scripts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTML and CSS, from HTML4 to 5 and CSS 2 to 3.
                </li>
                <li>
                    SCSS, this site is built using SCSS/SASS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ruby, this site has some custom scripts written in Ruby, but I wouldn't say I know any
                    Ruby what so ever, but the documentation is easy to follow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    TypeScript, used this to scale my JavaScript. Use this on a day to day basis now instead
                    of JavaScript. Really like how it's still JavaScript but for developers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rust, I have only started learning this language, but from my learning this language
                    is under-utilized within the industry right now. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Languages that I keep wanting to learn or just play around with:
            <li>
                C, I tried C++, you need to know C before you can move onto C++, but from reading online, 
                if you know C there is no need to learn C++. But I can't judge yet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Go lang, seems to have more backing than Rust but less than NodeJS. Even one of the main NodeJS 
                devs in the past left NodeJS to work on Go, this is one that I will definitely look into.
            </li>
            <li>
                Groovy, really so that I have a scripting language that works within the terminal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Kotlin, this one seems particularly interesting to me, because I started with Java. It has made some serious
                claims. Basically stating it is Java done correctly. I'm badly paraphrasing here, I know.
            </li>
            <li>
                Swift, only reason is because I started my career in a large company and needed to support all devices. If I personally
                 had a choice I wouldn't even bother looking into this language. So there is a good chance I never go into this.
            </li>

            As you can see my interest is programming and programming techniques, data structures and designs. By using many different
             languages I get a glimpse into the mind of the creator and I get better at programming that way. Expect me to compare languages
             all the time. Unless specific I will try to do each technique or alternative technique in as many languages as time permits.
